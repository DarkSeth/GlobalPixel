Custom renderer feature to pixelate the screen

Code Walkthrough: [youtube video](https://youtu.be/nvIyQHbhTJE)

I'm experimenting with this effect to not have to use two separate cameras as in my previous [approach](https://github.com/itsPeetah/PixelatedCamera).

The code might not be optimized since I don't really know how the RendererFeatures operate in depth.

To use this, go to your renderer settings and add the PixelizeFeature. Set your target height and you're on :)
